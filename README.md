# StateInstitutionsApp

The system is intended to enable entry of offenses from the field as well as their processing from the police through
the prosecution to the judiciary, with the possibility of reviewing the processed offenses by ordinary citizens. 
A police officer uses a mobile device to bring offense directly from the field, then communicate with the server
to bring these offenses into the database. After entering the database depending on the type and severity of the offense,
the processing procedure is initiated in the appropriate institution. After completing the processing of the offense, 
citizens on the basis of their JMBG and the authorized persons of the company on the basis of the PIB can commit offenses 
and punishments on the website.
